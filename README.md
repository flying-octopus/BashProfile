# *Fabulous bash profile!*

Inspired by [Nate Landou](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/)

## Installation
This repository includes a file install.sh in respective MacOS and Linux directories - run it in terminal by typing ./install.sh (while working directory contains install.sh that is)
and then restart terminal.app.
You may need to run `source ~/.bashrc` (`source ~/.bash_profile` for MacOS) or restart your terminal program to see the changes.


## Colour visualization
Program that visualises colours (256-colors.sh) in terminal taken from : [FLOZz' misc](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting)


### Ending note
Feel free to customize this bash profile.
