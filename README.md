	It requires following files to be working : 
		/usr/local/bin/git-completion.bash    (Line 36)
		/usr/local/bin/git-prompt.sh	 	   (Line 40)
		
		
	This git includes a file copy.sh - run it in terminal by typing ./copy.sh (while working directory contains copy.sh that is)
	and then restart terminal.app.
